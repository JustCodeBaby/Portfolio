Artemis Financial, a financial company, aims to offer a range of financial services tailored to meet consumer needs. Their objective is to ensure the security of data transmission, preventing unauthorized access. I found satisfaction in conducting dependency testing to identify vulnerabilities. Consequently, it is crucial to write secure code, minimizing the possibility of weak points that could be exploited by hackers. Incorporating software security enhances the overall reputation of a company, attracting more clients. However, one aspect of vulnerability assessment that proved challenging was identifying false positives. To enhance security measures, I implemented an SSL certificate and ensured the project utilized HTTP posts. Looking ahead, I plan to employ a strategy that involves assessing vulnerabilities, identifying and addressing false positives through effective mitigation techniques. To ensure both functionality and security of the code and software application, I repeatedly executed the project and conducted dependency checks. For code refactoring, I consistently ran the project to uncover any new vulnerabilities. A valuable resource for future endeavors would be the ability to view projects in a web browser within the Eclipse development environment. One specific accomplishment I would like to highlight is my Vulnerability Assessment Report, particularly my proficiency in locating and comprehending the provided information.

-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs usually begins with analyzing the system, involving team feedback and input from previous users for identifying errors or desired code modifications. It is important to identify inputs and outputs as well. User stories play a valuable role in gathering this information, as they allow users to express their needs and preferences. Examining user stories helps in comprehending the perspective of end users.
-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
There are two main approaches to program development. The Waterfall Method focuses on projecting specific strategy needs, while Agile offers a flexible and unique way to work with testing, planning, and client integration.
-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means to be dependable because everyone has a lot of responsibilty and if one person doesn't hold up their part, it could have bad consequences for the project. Also being a good team member is listening to feedback from others within the team.

I approach designing software by making sure to be able to keep an open mind to figuring things out and keeping a clear mind when things go wrong.The draw function helped me by being able to design my 2d scene and helped bring it to life and by following this it helped me accomplish the goals set out in the project, This will help in the futture by being able to design things and bring the imagination to life.I approach developing programs by being able to adjust and prepare for any road blocks
Iteration factored into my development by being able to render mutliple object into one scene.
Throughout the milestones I started understanding the concepts and strategies alot more and it was fun seeing my work get better as we move along.Computer science can help me in my goals by helping me giving me the tools to be able to develop apps and help make the things I want to make.Computational graphics and visualizations will help if i pursue a career in graphic designing for movies video games etc and by geting a taste of it, and seeing what goes into making the computer graphics possbile.

In this project, I was provided with starter code for a treasure hunt game where the pirate agent must navigate a maze to find the treasure before the player. The provided code included the game environment and an experience management system for storing the agent's learning episodes. My primary task was to complete the deep Q-learning algorithm, enabling the pirate agent to learn the optimal path through the maze. This involved writing code to manage exploration and exploitation, implementing experience replay, and training a neural network to predict the best actions based on the agent’s experiences.Through this project, I connected my learning from the course to broader computer science principles. Computer scientists are problem-solvers who apply logic and computational techniques to develop solutions, often involving complex algorithms and data structures. In this case, I used machine learning to build an intelligent agent capable of navigating dynamic environments. This is just one example of how computer science drives innovation in AI, software development, and numerous other fields that impact everyday life. As a computer scientist, ethical responsibilities play a significant role in the work we do. I must ensure that the solutions I create are fair, secure, and beneficial for the end users while aligning with the organization’s goals. For example, in AI projects, it is crucial to consider potential biases in the model and to implement safety measures to avoid harmful outcomes like misinformation or exploitation. Balancing the benefits of innovation with the responsibility to users and society is essential for ensuring that the advancements in technology have a positive impact.
