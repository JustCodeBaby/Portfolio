Artemis Financial, a financial company, aims to offer a range of financial services tailored to meet consumer needs. Their objective is to ensure the security of data transmission, preventing unauthorized access. I found satisfaction in conducting dependency testing to identify vulnerabilities. Consequently, it is crucial to write secure code, minimizing the possibility of weak points that could be exploited by hackers. Incorporating software security enhances the overall reputation of a company, attracting more clients. However, one aspect of vulnerability assessment that proved challenging was identifying false positives. To enhance security measures, I implemented an SSL certificate and ensured the project utilized HTTP posts. Looking ahead, I plan to employ a strategy that involves assessing vulnerabilities, identifying and addressing false positives through effective mitigation techniques. To ensure both functionality and security of the code and software application, I repeatedly executed the project and conducted dependency checks. For code refactoring, I consistently ran the project to uncover any new vulnerabilities. A valuable resource for future endeavors would be the ability to view projects in a web browser within the Eclipse development environment. One specific accomplishment I would like to highlight is my Vulnerability Assessment Report, particularly my proficiency in locating and comprehending the provided information.
