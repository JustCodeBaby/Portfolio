Artemis Financial, a financial company, aims to offer a range of financial services tailored to meet consumer needs. Their objective is to ensure the security of data transmission, preventing unauthorized access. I found satisfaction in conducting dependency testing to identify vulnerabilities. Consequently, it is crucial to write secure code, minimizing the possibility of weak points that could be exploited by hackers. Incorporating software security enhances the overall reputation of a company, attracting more clients. However, one aspect of vulnerability assessment that proved challenging was identifying false positives. To enhance security measures, I implemented an SSL certificate and ensured the project utilized HTTP posts. Looking ahead, I plan to employ a strategy that involves assessing vulnerabilities, identifying and addressing false positives through effective mitigation techniques. To ensure both functionality and security of the code and software application, I repeatedly executed the project and conducted dependency checks. For code refactoring, I consistently ran the project to uncover any new vulnerabilities. A valuable resource for future endeavors would be the ability to view projects in a web browser within the Eclipse development environment. One specific accomplishment I would like to highlight is my Vulnerability Assessment Report, particularly my proficiency in locating and comprehending the provided information.

-How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs usually begins with analyzing the system, involving team feedback and input from previous users for identifying errors or desired code modifications. It is important to identify inputs and outputs as well. User stories play a valuable role in gathering this information, as they allow users to express their needs and preferences. Examining user stories helps in comprehending the perspective of end users.
-How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
There are two main approaches to program development. The Waterfall Method focuses on projecting specific strategy needs, while Agile offers a flexible and unique way to work with testing, planning, and client integration.
-What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means to be dependable because everyone has a lot of responsibilty and if one person doesn't hold up their part, it could have bad consequences for the project. Also being a good team member is listening to feedback from others within the team.
